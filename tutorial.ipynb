    "fit(models,  input_data, startingParticipants=None, endingParticipants=None, input_data_id=\"PPT\", input_data_congruency=\"Condition\", input_data_rt=\"RT\", input_data_accuracy=\"Correct\", output_fileName='output.csv', return_dataframes=False, posterior_predictive_check=True)\n",

    "#### Fit Function Parameters\n",
    "Two required parameters: \n",
    "models (list): a list of model objects that you would like to use\n",
    "input_data (str or pd.DataFrame): the participant data that you would like the models to fit to \n",
    "Optional parameters: \n",
    "startingParticipants (int): specifies the ID number \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard format for the data is this: \n",
    "\n",
    "where there are 4 columns: PPT, Condition, Correct, RT. PPT stands for participant, Condition stands for whether or not it is congruency, Correct stands for accuracy, and RT stands for the reaction time. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your data has similar data but does not have the exact same columns, this works too! There is a feature in our `fit` function that allows users to modify the column names to align with their data. "
